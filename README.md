# P-Seeder engine

Webtorrent-based bittorent daemon that can be controlled through HTTP requests.

You can build with `npm run build`, run tests with `npm run test`
and run the actual program (once built) with `npm start`.

You can also use `npm link` once built to add a `pseederd` command to your `PATH`.
